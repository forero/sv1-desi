(1)  all LRG,ELG,QSO fields will be designed with 2X std star and sky
fiber allocation relative to 5yr program.  This is 200 std stars (at
best effort) and 800 sky fibers

(2)  before science targets, white dwarf stars will be assigned fibers
at the highest priority to assist in flux calibration tests.

(3)  each ELG field will be assigned fibers using the full SV target
lists with ELG only.

(4)  each LRG/QSO field will be assigned fibers using the full SV target
lists with QSO at highest priority and LRG at next highest priority.
At lowest priority will be ELG targets to soak up the remaining ~1000 fibers per
field.  To best effort, Anand will use either priorities or NOBS to
reject ELG targets that were assigned in (3)

(5)  There will be three field centers for LRG+QSO and three field
centers for ELG.  Those will be at the location of the DES SN field
(also XMM-LLS), COSMOS, and a third field that is visible in the middle
of the night.  The following field centers should be confirmed:

new moon is Dec 13:  23 57 <LST< 11 00

(a) First ~4 hours of night:  DES SN + XMM-LLS at (RA,DEC) = (36.448,
-4.601):  one ELG field and one LRG+QSO field

(b)  middle of night:  field in Bok+Mzls region
(RA,DEC) = (115, +50):  one ELG field and one LRG+QSO field

(c) last ~3 hours of night:  COSMOS at (RA,DEC) = (150.11916667,
+2.20583333):  one ELG field and one LRG+QSO field


Secondary targets are important, but will be assigned in the full suite
of fiber assignments starting in January.  For now, we should just plan
3 LRG+QSO fields and 3 ELG fields.  We also need a plan for BGS to be
sampled in varying moon conditions and a plan for MWS in December.
